# cardano-crypto-test

This package defines tests the implementations of the following cryptographic primitives:

  - A digital signature scheme

  - A cryptographic hashing function

  - A key-evolving signature scheme

  - A verifiable random function

Those implementations can be found in these packages:

  - cardano-crypto-class
  - cardano-crypto-praos
